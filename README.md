# Overview

Real Estate agents in King County, Seattle are evaluating the neighborhoods to encourage current home owners of he benefits of improving and upgrading their property value. Housing data from King County was used to develop linear regressions models to support future price prediction.

# Business Understanding



The primary stakeholders are real estate agents because of their wide use cases, network, domain knowledge and their incentive for home owners to increase their property value. They can also use this for getting a jump start on marketing to potential home buyers. The same predictions could be useful for the homeowners, potential buyers and even those in the remodeling and construction business. Because of their connection and real estate agents are able to influence a larger community's property value which as greater impact than convinving individual homeowners. The area attracts new implants from tech jobs. A great number of these people (as singles or families) may be looking to buy or rent.

This model is used as an intial model supporting course predictions. The main attributes used to support model prediciton are: Condition and Grade. The main attributes used to support model creation are:

'bedrooms', 'bathrooms', 'sqft_living', 'sqft_lot', 'floors',

'waterfront', 'yr_built', 'zipcode', 'cond_num', 'grade_num' 

I would not guarantee the price predicions are 100% accurate, but will be useful to support general predictions.
The model explains 67% of the variation. This means there are things that the model still doesn account for in making predictions.

# Data Understanding

This project uses the King County House Sales dataset (from GitHub project repo). This can be found in several locations: [Git Hub Data](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-phase-2-project-v2-3/tree/main/data) & [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction). 

The data is in the format of "csv". The initial data used in the modeling will start with 20 of possible attributes. As modeling progressing certain attributes (features) will be processed, transformed and possibly removed.

The imported data is the entire initial dataset. This will be scoped down before the intial understanding to support the the core modeling needs with the limited time available. Starting with the entire dataset could potentially support a more accurate model with the increase of the attributes to choose from. We will settle for good enough with the dataset we have.
